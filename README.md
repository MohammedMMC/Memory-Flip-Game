# Memory Flip Game

This is a simple and fun **Memory Flip Game** where you can test your memory by matching pairs of cards. The game features a 4x5 grid of cards, and your goal is to find all the matching pairs.

## How to Play

1. Download the game files and open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Click on any two cards to flip them over.
   - If the cards **match**, they will stay flipped.
   - If they **don't match**, they will flip back after a short delay.
3. The goal is to find all the matching pairs in the least number of tries.

Once you've matched all the cards, you can restart the game for another round of fun! :)
